# UX Skills – Credit Dispute Software

When reasoning about UX decisions:

- Prefer guidance over choice.
- Replace feature names with outcomes.
- Reduce visible options to the legally optimal path.
- Use reassuring, authoritative language.
- Avoid aggressive marketing tones.

Assume users are anxious, non-expert, and risk-averse.
Design for trust, not engagement metrics.
